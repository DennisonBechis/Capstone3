South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Gayle King,And Super Tuesday is just a week away and this is the biggest primary day of the year as voters in 14 states cast ballots and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind. So this debate when you think about it tonight may be the last best chance for the candidates to make their case to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters.,22.0

When you were asked a question, you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer and 45 seconds for followups. So let’s begin. Senator Sanders, we haven’t had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower. How will you convince voters that a democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?",31.0
South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Bernie Sanders,"Well, you’re right, the economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires. In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth. But you know what, for the ordinary American things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than one percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are under-insured. 45 million people are struggling with student debt. 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans. That is not an economy that’s working for the American people. That’s an economy working for the one percent. We’re going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors.",59.0

South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Norah O’Donnell,"Mayor Bloomberg, I’ll let you respond to that. Do you think Senator Sanders’ economy would be better for America than President Trump?",5.0
South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Mike Bloomberg,I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he’s president. I do not think so. Vladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be President of the United States. And that’s why Russia is helping you get elected so you lose to him.,19.0
South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Bernie Sanders,"Oh, Mr. Bloomberg. Let me tell Mr. Putin. Okay, I’m not a good friend of President Xi of China. I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader. And let me tell Mr. Putin who interfered in the 2016 election, try to bring Americans against Americans. Hey, Mr. Putin, if I’m President of the United States, trust me you’re not going to interfere in anymore American elections.",27.0

South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Elizabeth Warren,"Look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party and progressive ideas are popular ideas. Even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don’t want to say so. But Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie. And the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard and it’s going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen. Bernie and I both wanted to help reign in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance, but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won. Bernie and I both want to see universal healthcare, but Bernie’s plan doesn’t explain how to get there, doesn’t show how we’re going to get enough allies into it and doesn’t show enough about how we’re going to pay for it.",60.0
South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Elizabeth Warren,"I dug in, I did the work and then Bernie’s team trashed me for it. We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work and actually get it done. Progressive’s have got one shot and we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done.",19.0
South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Gayle King,"Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you in his conversation. Why would the Russians to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders?",6.0
South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Pete Buttigieg,"I’ll tell you what the Russians want. They don’t have a political party. They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. And meanwhile, folks at home from South Carolina to South Bend are trying to figure out what any of this means for us. Because it’s right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement. But also there’s the majority of the American people who I think right now just to be able to turn on the TV, see their President and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit instead of up through the roof. We have an opportunity to set a different tone.",62.0

South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Tom Steyer,"Bernie Sanders’ analysis is right. The difference is I don’t like his solutions. I don’t believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families. I think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant competitive private sector, but we all know unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer’s not for the government to take over the private sector though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.",38.0

South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Tom Steyer,"Well, let me just finish because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump. I’m talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10% for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over four and a half million good paying union jobs. Donald Trump stinks. He’s incompetent. As a steward of the American economy, we have to show that we can create a growing prosperous economy [crosstalk 00:07:13] that works for American working people.",27.0

Walking distance here is Mother Emanuel Church. Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist. Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and monitored a waiting period … No, let me finish. A waiting period of 12 hours. I’m not saying he’s responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared. In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama, he wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should. And in fact the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, let’s talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done. And that’s what we got done.

Joe I think, has gotten a little bit more. What the American people want by the way, and a lot of the issues we’ll be discussing tonight are issues I raised four years ago. Raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour, making public colleges and universities tuition free and finally doing what every other major country on Earth does, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right to a Medicare For All single payer system [crosstalk 00:00:09:14].",37.0

I’ve been coming here for years and years creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million in our administration just into this county. We’ve created jobs for people. The people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties. I don’t expect anything. I plan to earn the vote.

And I’ve earned the respect of people in New York City. I was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for 12 years, and people will tell you it’s a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better. The budget’s under control. We’ve done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities.",36.0

Do you think the New York City’s implementation of stop and frisk was racist?",13.0
South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Pete Buttigieg,"Yes. In effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped White people too often and minorities too little. And I’m not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.",24.0

South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 1: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Amy Klobuchar,"Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we’re going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.

In those 25 years, we’ve had Columbine, Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas. We could go on and on. Vice President Biden, I want to start with you. Why should anyone have faith that you’re the one who can get this done now?",58.0

I beat the NRA twice. I got assault weapons banned. I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them, I got them eliminated, except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida, and it was not reauthorized. In addition to that, I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend on my right and others have in fact also given to the gun manufacturers absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said, “We give immunity to drug companies. We give immunity to tobacco companies.” That has caused carnage on our streets. 150 million people have been killed since 2007, when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam from that point on.

And actually, I am the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms, in rural areas be covered. The other issue is we don’t have enough personnel.

We’re not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees, we’re going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses. So putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one and two year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas.

When I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy if you were born in a rural area or a city. Now the gap is the biggest it’s been in a generation. And that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina. We’re seeing hospital closures right and left, and we’re seeing them in particular in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families, and is largely the result of racial voter suppression. See, all of these things are connected. Housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter roles, to the closing of voting locations.

So let’s get serious here. But I do think it’s the government’s job to have good science, and to explain to people what science says, or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. We are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just take a look at what happened with smoking. We did ban smoking in New York City, in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing.

Number two, only solution here is a two state solution. The Palestinians have to be accommodated. The real problem here is you have two groups of people, both of who think God them the same piece of land. And the answer is to obviously split it up, leave the Israeli borders where they are.

He asked the question of whether healthcare for everybody is a radical idea. And it’s not, which is why I’m for it, very much in a different way though.

First, I’d like you each to tell us the biggest misconception about you. That’s number one. Number two, the South Carolina motto is this, while I breathe, I hope. So outside of politics and no more than 45 seconds or so, what is your personal motto, your personal belief, your favorite quote that represents you?

South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 3: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Amy Klobuchar,"I’d say the biggest … The biggest misconception is that I’m boring, because I’m not. I would say that my motto is the words of one of my political mentors, Paul Wellstone, who’s sadly no longer with us. And he said that politics is about improving people’s lives. And that’s been my life from when my grandpa was an iron ore miner and the union’s politics made them those mines safer. And when my dad needed treatment, it was there for him, and in his words, he was pursued by grace. And when my mom got divorced and she didn’t have a job and she went back to teaching and that gift of public service got her through. And then when our daughter was born-",47.0

South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript: February 25 Democratic Debate,Part 3: South Carolina Democratic Debate Transcript,Bernie Sanders,"Misconception, and you’re hearing it here tonight, is that the ideas I’m talking about are radical. They’re not. In one form or another, they exist in countries all over the world. Healthcare is a human right. We have the necessity, the moral imperative to address the existential threat of climate change. Other countries are doing that. We don’t need more people in jail, disproportionately African American, than any other country on earth. Not a radical idea. The motto, the saying that that moves me the most is from Nelson Mandela and Mandela said, “Everything is impossible until it happens.” And that means, if we have the guts to stand up to powerful special interest, we’re doing phenomenally well.

No, I got into this because I am a fighter. My motto ties in directly to this. It’s Matthew 25 and that is in as much as she hath done it into one of these, the least of thy brethren, ye have done it unto me. For me, this is about how we treat other people and how we lift them up. That is why I am in this fight. That is why I am running to be president and it is why I will be an effective president.",51.0

And of course the teaching not unique to the Christian tradition, but a big part of it that holds that we are to treat others as we would be treated. And when I think about everything at stake, from racial and economic justice, to our stewardship of the climate, to the need to heal the sick, and the need to heal this country, I seek for those teachings to order my steps as I go through this campaign, and as I go through life.",30.0
