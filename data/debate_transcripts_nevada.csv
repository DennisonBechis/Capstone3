"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"Good evening everyone. I’m Lester Holt. Welcome to Las Vegas. Everything is on the line tonight, with just three days before the critical Nevada caucuses. Here with me on the stage tonight, NBC News Political Director and moderator of Meet the Press, Chuck Todd. And NBC News Chief White House correspondent and MSNBC anchor, Hallie Jackson. Also joining us is Telemundo’s Senior Correspondent, Vanessa Hauc. And editor of the Nevada Independent Jon Ralston, who has covered Nevada politics for more than three decades. The rules are this tonight, candidates will get a minute 15 to answer each question and 45 seconds for followups. Now that the stage has narrowed to six candidates, we encourage each of you to directly engage with each other on the issues.",47.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"So let’s get to our first question. Since the last time you all shared the stage, Senator Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has surged into the lead nationally in the democratic race. And there’s a new person on the stage tonight, Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A former Republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race. What hasn’t changed? A majority of democratic voters still say their top priority is beating President Trump. Senator Sanders, the first question to you, Mayor Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says he’s best positioned to win in November. Why is your revolution a better bet?",38.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Bernie Sanders,"In order to beat Donald Trump, we’re going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York city of stop-and-frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout. What our movement is about is bringing working class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class. And that agenda says that maybe, just maybe, we should join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right, raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an hour. And have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry, because their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change. Those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump.",70.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"Mayor Bloomberg, can Senator Sanders beat President Trump and how do you want to respond to what else he said?",5.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Michael Bloomberg,"I don’t think there’s any chance of the Senator beating President Trump. You don’t start out by saying, “I’ve got 160 million people, I’m going to take away the insurance plan that they love.” That’s just not a ways that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders’ camp thinks that they can do. I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever, and if he goes and is the candidate, we will have Donald Trump for another four years and we can’t stand that.",31.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,Senator Warren.,2.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"I’d like to talk about who we’re running against. A billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians. And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump, I’m talking about mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk. Look, I’ll support whoever the democratic nominee is, but understand this, Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt. It is time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and be willing to get out there and fight for them. That is why I am in this race and that is how I will beat Donald Trump.",60.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"[crosstalk 00:04:14] Senator Klobuchar, what do you think the path is from this stage to the White House? What works?",7.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"I think the path is a high voter turnout. I’m the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country, when I led the tip ticket. As well as bringing in rural and suburban voters and I’ve done that as well. And I’m the only one with the receipts to have done that in Republican congressional districts over and over again. But I want to say this, I actually welcomed Mayor Bloomberg to the stage. I thought that he shouldn’t be hiding behind his TV ads, and so I was already for this big day. And then I looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way. That is what his campaign said, because we should pave the way for him to become the nominee.",46.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit and because of the people out there. I’ve been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside and I’m not going to do that now and I’m not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him. I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I don’t think you look at Donald Trump and say, we need someone richer in the white house.",33.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"Thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, there’s a lot for you to respond to there, so here’s your opportunity.",5.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Michael Bloomberg,"I think we have two questions to face tonight. One is, who can beat Donald Trump? And number two, who can do the job if they get into the White House? And I would argue that I am candidate that can do exactly both of those things. I’m a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant con man like Donald Trump that comes from New York. I’m a mayor. I was a mayor. I know how to run a complicated city, the biggest, most diverse city in this country. I’m a manager. I knew what to do after 9-11 and brought the city back stronger than ever. And I’m a philanthropist who didn’t inherit his money, but made his money. And I’m spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst President we have ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids.",54.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"Vice President Biden, I’ll let you weigh in there.",4.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Joe Biden,"In terms who can beat Donald Trump, NBC did a poll yesterday, says Joe Biden is best equipped to beat Donald Trump. That’s what your poll said. And it said that I can beat him in those toss up states too, those states we have to win. I’m ahead by eight points across the board. So in terms of being able to beat Donald Trump, I’m better positioned according to your poll than anybody else to beat Donald Trump, number one. Number two, the Mayor makes an interesting point. The mayor says that he has a great record, that he’s done these wonderful things.",31.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Joe Biden,"Well the fact of the matter is, he has not managed his city very, very well when he was there. He didn’t get a whole lot done. He has stop-and-frisk, throwing close to 5 million young black men up against a wall. And when we came along in our administration, President Obama and said, “We’re going to send in a mediator to stop it.” He said, “That’s unnecessary.” So we’re going to get a chance to talk about the mayor’s record, but in terms of who is best prepared to beat Donald Trump, look at your poll and what it says.",33.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"Mayor Buttigieg, you’d like to weigh in.",2.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,"Yes, we’ve got to wake up as a party. We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage. And most Americans don’t see where they fit, if they’ve got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power. Let’s put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middle-class neighborhood, in an industrial Midwestern city. Let’s put forward somebody who’s actually a Democrat. Look, we shouldn’t have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better.",57.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"Senator Sanders, are you polarizing?",4.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Bernie Sanders,"If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word. What we are trying finally to do, is to give a voice to people who have to 45 years of work are not making a nickel more than they did 45 years ago. We are giving a voice to people who are saying we are sick of tired of billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth, while a half a million people sleep out on the street tonight. And that’s what we are saying, Pete, is maybe it’s a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in Washington rather than your billionaire campaign contributors.",46.0

As a matter of fact, you’re the one who is at war with the Culinary Union right here in Las Vegas. We can’t-",21.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,We can actually deliver healthcare without taking it away from anyone. We can actually empower workers and lift wages without further polarizing this country and we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking democratic figures and union leaders alike-,18.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Hallie Jackson,"Senator Warren, I have a question for you. On Sunday, on Meet the Press, Vice President Biden accused Senator Sanders supporters of bullying union leaders here with, “Vicious, malicious misogynistic things.” You said Democrats cannot build an inclusive party on a foundation of hate. Are Senator Sanders and his supporters making it harder for Democrats to unify in November?",22.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"Look, I have said many times before, we are all responsible for our supporters. And we need to step up, that’s what leadership is all about. But the way we are going to lead this country and beat Donald Trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock solid values and who actually gets something done. When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas, literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families.",39.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"That’s when I met Mr. Estrada, one of your neighbors. He came in to testify and he said he thought he’d done everything right with Wells Fargo. But what had happened? They took away his house in a matter of weeks. This man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary schools, that they might be living out of their van. I spent the next years making sure that would never happen again. Wall Street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency. They lost and I won. We need a candidate with unshakeable values and a candidate who can actually get something done for working people. That’s why I’m in this race-",45.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Bernie Sanders,"We have over 10.6 million people on Twitter and 99.9% of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion and love. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disowned those people, they are not part of our movement. But let me also say, what I hope my friends up here will agree with, is that if you look at the wild West of the internet, talk to some of the African American women on my campaign, talk to Senator Nina Turner, talk to others and find the vicious racist, sexist attacks that are coming their way as well. So I would hope that all of us understand that we should do everything we possibly can to end the viciousness and ugliness on the internet. Our campaign is about issues. It’s about fighting for the working families and the middle class. It is not about vicious attacks on other people.",70.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,"But at a certain point you got to ask yourself, why did this pattern arise? Why is it especially the case among your supporters that this happens?",7.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Bernie Sanders,"Pete if you want to talk to some of the women on my campaign, what you will see is the most ugly, sexist, racist attacks that are… I won’t even describe them here, they’re so disgusting. And let me say something else about this, not being too paranoid. All of us remember 2016 and what we remember his efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up. I’m not saying that’s happening, but it would not shock me. I saw some of those tweets regarding the Culinary Workers Union. I have a 30 year, 100% pro-union voting record. Do you think I would support or anybody supports me, would be attacking union leaders? It’s not thinkable.",42.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,"But leadership is about what you draw out of people. It’s about how you inspire people to act. And right now we’re in this toxic political environment. Leadership isn’t just about policy. I think, at least in broad terms, we’re largely pulling in the same direction on policy. But leadership is also about how you motivate people to treat other people and I think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign and in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others? Because in order to turn the page-",33.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"I have an idea. I have an idea of how we can stop sexism on the internet. We could nominate a woman for candidate for President of the United States. I think that might go a long way, if we showed our stuff as a party. And the other thing I’m going to talk about is really what is at the core of this issue between Senator Sanders and the Culinary Union. And that is this, these are hardworking people. Housekeepers, like Elizabeth and I met with last night, who have healthcare plans that have been negotiated over time, sweat and blood. And that is the truth for so many Americans right now-",37.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Hallie Jackson,Senator thank you.,1.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Hallie Jackson,"On that note, I want to turn it over to my colleague Chuck Todd.",2.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Chuck Todd,"Senator Sanders, I’m going to stay on this topic, on this issue with the Culinary Union. Obviously their leaders are warning their members about that your health care plan will take away their healthcare plan, take away private insurance completely. There are some Democrats who like you a lot, but worry that this plan, Medicare-for-all, is going to take away private insurance and that it goes too far. Are they right?",27.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Bernie Sanders,"No. Let me be very clear, two points. For a hundred years, from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama, this country has been talking about the need to guarantee health care for people. And yet today, despite spending twice as much per capita, Chuck, twice as much as any other major country on earth, we got 87 million who are uninsured or under insured. We got over 60,000 people who die every year because they don’t get to a doctor on time. We’re getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same drugs because of their price fixing. 500,000 people go bankrupt every year because they can’t afford medical bills. So let me be very clear, to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union, a great union, I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have. We will only expand it, for them, for every union in America and for the working class of this country.",69.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Chuck Todd,"Senator Warren, you were all in on Medicare-for-all and then you have since came up with a transition plan. Is it because of the impact on unions?",9.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"So I want to be clear. I’ve been to the Culinary Unions’ healthcare facilities, they’re terrific. You don’t want to shut them down, you want to expand them. You want to see them all across Nevada and all across this country. But we need to get everybody’s healthcare plan out here. Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants, to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their healthcare. It’s not a plan, it’s a PowerPoint. And Amy’s plan is even less, it’s like a Post-it Note, insert plan here. Bernie has started very much, has a good start.",46.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Elizabeth Warren,"But instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisor’s say, “Eh, probably won’t happen anyway.” Look, healthcare is a crisis in this country. My approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can. And if we don’t get it all the first time, take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more.",41.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,"I’m more of a Microsoft Word guy. And if you look at my plan, I don’t know if there are any PowerPoints on it, but you can definitely find the document on peteforamerica.com. And you’ll see that it is a plan that solves the problem, makes sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and does it without kicking anybody off the plan that they have. This idea that the union members don’t know what’s good for them is the exact kind of condescension and arrogance that makes people skeptical of the policies we’ve been putting forward.",29.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Pete Buttigieg,"Here we have a plan that the majority of Americans support. Do you realize how historic that is? That the American people are ready in a way, far beyond what was true even 10 years ago and what was available to President Obama at the time. There’s a powerful American majority ready to undertake the biggest, most progressive reform we’ve had in healthcare in 50 years, just so long as we don’t force it on anybody. What is wrong with that?",26.0

So my plan is a public option and according to all the studies out there, it would reduce premiums for 12 million people immediately. It would expand coverage for about that same number. It is a significant thing, it is what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning. And the way I look at it since we’re in Vegas, when it comes to your plan, Elizabeth and Bernie’s on Medicare-for-all, you don’t put your money on a number that’s not even on the wheel.",39.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Amy Klobuchar,"And why is Medicare-for-all not on the wheel? Why is it not on the wheel? Because two thirds of the democratic Senators are not even on that bill, because a bunch of the new House members that got elected see the problems with blowing up the Affordable Care Act.

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"… at the beginning of this debate, you took some incoming fire on this next topic, so let’s get into it. In 2015 this is how you described your policing policy as mayor quote, “We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods.” And you explain that is quote, “Because that’s where all the crime is.”",16.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"You went on to say, “And the way you should get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them.” You’ve apologized for that policy, but what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods?",14.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Michael Bloomberg,"Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I’m really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with Stop and Frisk. When I got into office, there was 650 murders a year in New York City. I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live. That’s the basic right of everything. And we started, we adopted a policy which had been in place. The policy that all big police departments use of stop and frisk.",36.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Michael Bloomberg,"What happened, however was it got out of control. And when we discovered, I discovered, that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut 95% of it out. I’ve sat down with a bunch of African-American clergy and business people to talk about this, to try to learn. I’ve talked to a number of kids who’d been stopped. I was trying to understand how we change our policies so we can keep the city safe because the crime rate did go from 650, 50% down, to 300. And we have to keep lid on crime, but we cannot go out and stop people indiscriminately. That was what was happening.",44.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Lester Holt,"Mayor, thank you. Let me go to Vice President Biden with this. You want to respond to that? Put an end to it?",4.0
"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Joe Biden,"Yes. Let’s get something straight. The reason the stop and frisk change is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on. When we sent them there to say, “This practice has to stop,” the mayor thought it was a terrible idea. We send them there, a terrible idea. Let’s get the facts straight. Let’s get the order straight. And it’s not whether he apologize or not, it’s the policy. The policy was abhorrent and it was, in fact, of violation of every right people have. We are the one, our administration sent in people to monitor it. And the very time the mayor argued against that. This idea that he figured out it was a bad idea. He figured out it was a bad idea after we sent in monitors and said it must stop. Even then he continued the policy.",51.0

"Democratic Debate Transcript: Las Vegas, Nevada Debate",Part 1,Michael Bloomberg,"Yes, I would. I’ve sat. I’ve apologized. I’ve asked for forgiveness, but the bottom line is that we stopped too many people. We stopped too many people and we’ve got to make sure that we do something about criminal justice in this country. There is no great answer to a lot of these problems.

This is about what it was designed to do to begin with. It targeted communities of color, it targeted black and brown men from the beginning. And if you want to issue a real apology, then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together and the willful ignorance day by day by day of admitting what was happening. Even as people protested in your own street, shutting out the sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives. You need a different apology.",55.0

You did prosecute a black teenager who was sentenced to life in prison despite what are now serious doubts about the evidence.

He said just a letter from a doctor is enough, and a lot of folks on this stage are now saying that’s enough. But I am certainly prepared to get a physical, put out the results.

But I think the goal of someone in government and a President of the United States should be a check on that. I’m not going to limit what people make, but I think right now our tax code is so tilted against regular people and that is what’s wrong. I was thinking of your question about small businesses. The small businesses I talked to, they have trouble getting employees because their employees don’t have childcare. We should have universal childcare. And we have not been talking enough about Donald Trump and let’s just talk about Donald Trump because he signed that tax bill that helped the wealthy. And he went down Mar-a-Lago and he said to all his friends, “You just got a lot richer.” That is Exhibit A. And I can tell you the hardworking people in Nevada, were not in that room.

That should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets, where we have kids who cannot afford to go to college, when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt. We have enormous problems facing this country and we cannot continue seeing a situation where in the last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth.

It means we can have universal pre-K for every child in America.
